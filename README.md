# Pomoblocko
~ ***bismillah*** ~ \
Ever used the pomodoro timer or a website blocker to get back on track? **Pomoblocko** is an extension that combines both of those ideas! While the timer is on (*25 minutes work*), websites are blocked, but during break time (*5 minutes break*) they are not.

# Functionality
There are 3 main buttons with use — the *Todolist Button*, *Sitelist Button*, and the *Blacklist/Whitelist Toggle*. \
(There is a Settings button, but it does not currently have a function)

## Todolist Button
When clicking on the Todolist button, a popup that allows you to input a task is shown. Tasks are saved for you to check back on whenever you need to remember what to do.

## Site Blocking
To set the sites you want to block or unblock, the sitelist button is used. Site URLs are inputted by you and are then saved. Whether you want to blacklist certain sites to keep you off of them or whitelist certain sites to make sure you only stay on productive sites is completely up to you!
When the timer becomes the break timer, the blockscreen is removed from blocked websites.

## Acknowledgements
***First and foremost, I'm grateful to Allah (God, ﷻ) for allowing me to finish this.*** \
Moreover, I'm thankful that [Hack Club](hackclub.com) hosted the High Seas event, alongside many others, that motivated me to make things such as, and including, Pomoblocko. \
This [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58132891/chrome-timer-extension-how-to-keep-timer-running-even-when-extension-is-closed) thread was also immensely helpful to developing the base of the JS for the timer. \
Finally, and somewhat humbly and ashamedly, I'd like to admit that **a lot of AI, in the form of ChatGPT as well as Github Copilot, was used in the making of Pomoblocko**. I'd call it a **70-15-15** split between AI, Stack Overflow, and me, more or less.
